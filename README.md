# CS6316-ML-Project
This is the repository for CS6316 Machine Learning Application project

###
```Part_1.ipynb``` file has the code for implementing part 1 as the project requirement.

```MNIST_*.ipynb``` files has the incremental development for Neural Network part of the project.

1. Load the compressed MNIST dataset to Google Colab session
2. Run ipnyb file in order

- First part is for processing the data to train in the learning model. We change the processed data to the format of list.
- Next part is for training model with default parameter
- Different hidden unit experiments part
- Different weight/bias initialization experiments part
- Different learning rate experiments
